                  A loot box is a probabilistic allocation of virtual products, the exact outcome of which is known to consumers only after purchase. Consumers sometimes purchase these goods multiple times until their preferred products are obtained. As loot boxes have been gaining enormous popularity in recent years, they are often criticized as exploitative and socially wasteful. In this study, we develop a stylized model to study the optimal design of loot boxes and its impact on profits and social welfare. We find that firms may assign asymmetric probabilities to ex ante symmetric products. Firms could use loot boxes to offer products at low prices to users who would not buy these products under the traditional pricing strategy. Loot boxes enable firms to earn higher profits due to better price discrimination and market expansion. Contrary to the widespread criticism of loot boxes as socially harmful, our analysis reveals that the loot box strategy can improve social welfare. Some platforms promise that consumers can obtain their preferred products with no more than a certain number of purchases. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our analysis reveals that such a strategy can increase firm’s profits while reducing consumer welfare.

              <p>Sanjay Jain, Jin Miao</p>

                <p>
                  Firms often offer subscriptions for services such as extended warranties for automobiles or appliances and subscription plans for golf or symphony. Before purchasing a subscription, consumers need to estimate the probability of needing the service in the future. Most of the prior research assumes that consumers form an unbiased estimate of their future needs. Empirical evidence, however, shows that consumers often make errors in predicting future needs. We draw on the literature on the availability bias (Tversky and Kahneman 1973) to model how consumers form subjective probabilities of needing the service. We then examine the optimal design of service contracts when the seller serves consumers influenced by the availability heuristic. We show that availability bias can lead firms to offer subscription plans with below marginal cost pricing at the time of service. Contrary to intuition, we find that availability bias can sometimes benefit consumers at the expense of firms. Furthermore, an increase in market-level bias can sometimes improve social welfare. Our results also demonstrate that availability bias can lead firms to provide socially wasteful services, where the service cost exceeds the valuation for all consumers. We also find that even perfect competition cannot eliminate the negative impact of availability bias.

                  <li>Great class! I learned a lot and was able to grasp marketing a lot better than I originally anticipated after completing the course.</li>
                  <li>Everything in this course was great. The exams were a bit challenging, especially the math portions for the final exam but other than that, this class was a pleasure to take. Thank you!</li>
                  <li>The prof is great and the way that he teaches makes everything easy to understand.</li>
                  <li>The course overall was high in terms of memorability, personally. I would suggest feeling more comfortable with the class, which would reciprocate with the class feeling more comfortable as well. You are incredibly knowledgeable, and I can rely on your responses to satisfy questions regarding key concepts and requirements, if needed. I am overall very happy with how the semester came to be, and it is very bittersweet to meet the end of it. Best of luck!</li>
                  <li>I am very satisfied with my experience in this course. The professor was excellent—knowledgeable, approachable, and always willing to help. The assignments, homework, and tests were fair and aligned well with the material covered in class. Overall, it was a great learning experience, and I wouldn’t change anything.</li>
